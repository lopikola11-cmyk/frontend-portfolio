# 🌐 Portfolio – Abderrahman Zerouali

Welcome to my coding portfolio! 🚀  
This repository showcases my journey as a **Self-Taught Front-End Developer** through hands-on projects.  
I focus on building clean, functional, and responsive applications while continuously improving my problem-solving skills.

## 🛠️ Skills
- HTML5 / CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Git & GitHub  
- Data Structures & Algorithms (learned after completing these projects)

## 🔎 Note
All of these projects were built **completely by hand without AI assistance**.  
My main goal was to strengthen my **foundations** in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

📌 These projects were created **before I learned Data Structures, Algorithms, and annotations**.  
Later, I realized the importance of **server-side thinking** and **code optimization**.  
In the future, I plan to revisit these projects, integrate advanced concepts, and also leverage **AI tools** to build faster and more scalable applications.
