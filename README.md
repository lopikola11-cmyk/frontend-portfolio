# 🚀 Front-End Portfolio – Abderrahman Zerouali

Welcome to my portfolio!  
This repository showcases my journey as a **self-taught Front-End Developer** focused on building real, scalable applications with clean logic, strong architecture, and production-style workflows.

I write everything from scratch — no templates — to master fundamentals deeply.  
I use AI tools intelligently as debugging assistants, not as copy-paste shortcuts.

# 🌟 Featured Projects

## 🛒 Amazon Clone – React + Vite + Backend API (Full Deployment)
**My first full React project with real backend integration and real deployment.**

- **Live Frontend (Vercel):** https://amazon-clone-react-vite.vercel.app/  
- **Live Backend API (Render):** https://amazon-backend-dkf4.onrender.com/api/products  
- **Repository:** https://github.com/lopikola11-cmyk/amazon-clone-react-vite  
- **Stack:** React, Vite, Axios, React Router, day.js, Node.js backend  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Real backend integration (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)  
  - Full cart system with quantities, delivery options, order placement  
  - Tracking system using dynamic URL parameters  
  - Clean React architecture with state lifting  
  - Advanced debugging of API flows and deployment errors  
  - Deployed **frontend on Vercel** and **backend on Render Free Tier**  
  - Connected frontend ↔ backend using full production API URLs  
  - Solved CORS, routing, proxy, and Git merge issues  
  - Learned backend startup logs, server cold boots, deployment pipeline  

> I did **not** write the backend myself, but I learned how to run it locally, integrate it fully, debug it, and deploy it successfully — a major full-stack milestone.

This project represents my transition into **real front-end engineering + backend integration + deployment**.

# 💡 Learning Philosophy

I focus on understanding **how things work under the hood**.

All my Vanilla JS apps were built by hand to master fundamentals.  
My React apps show my growth into **true front-end engineering** through real architecture, real logic, and real debugging.

> “I don’t use AI to copy code — I use it to think better, debug faster, and build bigger.”

# 🎯 Future Goals
- Authentication (JWT / OAuth)  
- TypeScript  
- Express.js  
- Databases (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)  
- Full-stack applications  
- Advanced chat features (search, export, themes)  
- More complex deployments and pipelines
