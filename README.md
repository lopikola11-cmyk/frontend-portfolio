## 🛠️ Skills

- Git & GitHub  
- Data Structures & Algorithms (learned after completing these projects)

## 🔎 Note
All of these projects were built **completely by hand without AI assistance**.  
My main goal was to strengthen my **foundations** in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

📌 These projects were created **before I learned Data Structures, Algorithms, and code annotations**.  
Later, I realized the importance of **server-side thinking** and **code optimization**,  
so in the future I plan to revisit my projects and integrate these concepts.  

I believe in mastering the fundamentals first.  
From there, I’ll use **AI tools** and advanced techniques to build faster and more scalable applications.
