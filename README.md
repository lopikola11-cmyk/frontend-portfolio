🔎 Note

All of these projects were built completely by hand without AI assistance. My main goal was to strengthen my foundations in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📌 These projects were created before I learned Data Structures, Algorithms, and annotations. Later, I realized the importance of server-side thinking and code optimization. In the future, I plan to revisit these projects, integrate advanced concepts, and also leverage AI tools to build faster and more scalable applications.
