# 🚀 Front-End Portfolio – Abderrahman Zerouali

Welcome to my portfolio!  
This repository showcases my journey as a **self-taught Front-End Developer** focused on building real, scalable applications with clean logic, strong architecture, and production-style workflows.

I write everything from scratch — no templates — to master fundamentals deeply.  
I use AI tools intelligently as debugging assistants, not as copy-paste shortcuts.

# 💡 Learning Philosophy

I focus on understanding **how things work under the hood**.

All my Vanilla JS apps were built by hand to master fundamentals.  
My React apps show my growth into **true front-end engineering** through real architecture, real logic, and real problem-solving.

> “I don’t use AI to copy code — I use it to think better, debug faster, and build bigger.”
